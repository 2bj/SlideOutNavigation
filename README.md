AMSlideOutNavigationController
==================

SlideOut Navigation Controller for iOS.
This controller replicates the behaviour of the 'slide-out' navigation of applications like Facebook or Steam.
The project currently mimics FB's app styling, you can change all the table colors in the ```AMSlideOutGlobals.h```. 
ARC only.

Part of the code is based off [this blog post made by Nick Harris](http://nickharris.wordpress.com/2012/02/05/ios-slide-out-navigation-code/)

Setup
--------------------
* Add the ```AMSlideOut``` folder to your project
* Link against ```QuartzCore``` framework
* Import ```AMSlideOutNavigationController.h``` in your AppDelegate
* Init ```AMSlideOutNavigationController```  using the data structure as follows.

Init data
--------------------
The ViewControllers presented by the SlideOut navigation are arranged in sections and rows of a UITableView.
You need to init the controller passing an array of sections. Each section item is a dictionary, containing the section title and an array describing the ViewControllers. Each item of this array is a dictionary containing the title, 44x44 icon (if present), a numeric tag and the reference to the ViewController. 

You can use the following helper methods to setup your views:

* ```addSectionWithTitle:``` to add a section
* ```addViewControllerToLastSection:tagged:withTitle:andIcon:``` to add a viewcontroller to the last section
* ```addViewController:tagged:withTitle:andIcon:toSection:``` to add a viewcontroller to a specific section

You can also pass the complete data structure to the init method, but it's not recommended. 

	[self.slideoutController addViewControllerToLastSection:controller
													 tagged:1
												  withTitle:@"First View"
													andIcon:@"icon1.png"];

Check out the sample to understand how these methods work.

Sample
--------------------
	self.slideoutController = [AMSlideOutNavigationController slideOutNavigation];

	// Add a first section
	[self.slideoutController addSectionWithTitle:@"Section One"];

	// Add two viewcontrollers to the first section
	controller = [[UIViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"FirstViewController" bundle:nil];
	[self.slideoutController addViewControllerToLastSection:controller tagged:1 withTitle:@"First View" andIcon:@"icon1.png"];

	controller = [[UIViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"SecondViewController" bundle:nil];
	[self.slideoutController addViewControllerToLastSection:controller tagged:2 withTitle:@"Second View" andIcon:@"icon2.png"];

	// Add a second section
	[self.slideoutController addSectionWithTitle:@"Section Two"];

	// Add two viewcontrollers to the second section
	controller = [[UIViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"FirstViewController" bundle:nil];
	[self.slideoutController addViewControllerToLastSection:controller tagged:3 withTitle:@"First View" andIcon:@"icon1.png"];

	controller = [[UIViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"SecondViewController" bundle:nil];
	[self.slideoutController addViewControllerToLastSection:controller tagged:4 withTitle:@"Second View" andIcon:@"icon2.png"];
	
	[self.window setRootViewController:self.slideoutController];

Sections
--------------------
Leave the section name blank if you don't want the section header visible.

Badges
--------------------
Set the badge value (NSString) via the method ```setBadgeValue:forTag:```. This sets the badge value of the row with the numeric tag provided during the views' setup.

	[self.slideoutController setBadgeValue:@"10" forTag:3];

Icons
--------------------
The icon must be 44x44. Blank icon name will result in a row with only text, with different indentation
